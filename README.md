# n8n-nodes-agent-brains

AgentBrains nodes for n8n to integrate your workflows with the AgentBrains platform. Use these nodes to connect production webhooks for custom AI employee integrations and to run Synthetic User validation tests against your flows.

AgentBrains helps businesses build, validate, and manage AI employees with curated knowledge, configurable scoring, and an operational Inbox for monitoring and improvement. These nodes make it straightforward to plug your n8n workflows into AgentBrains for real-world operation and testing.

## Installation

Follow the n8n community nodes installation guide: https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/

## Trigger Node: AgentBrains Integration Trigger

- Starts your n8n workflow from AgentBrains via production webhook.
- Registers on workflow activation and unregisters on deactivation for clean lifecycle management.
- Works for production AI employee integrations (e.g., sales, support, setup assistants) and for running Synthetic User tests to validate flows before and after launch.

### Typical Uses

- Trigger consumer workflows from AgentBrains using the production webhook URL.
- Validate workflows with Synthetic Users configured in AgentBrains and attach scoring to conversations.
- Centralize monitoring and triage in AgentBrains Inbox while executing logic in n8n.

## Credentials

- Create an account and generate an access token: https://agent-brains.com/system-integration
- Add credentials in n8n and select them on the node to authenticate requests.

## Usage Notes

- For production usage, activate your workflow so the production webhook is registered.
- Use “Respond using ‘Respond to Webhook’ node” to return data generated by downstream nodes or “Last Node” to return the final item.
- When credentials or webhook URLs change, re-activate the workflow to refresh the registration state.
